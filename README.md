### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ This github page host my hobby projects:
- [genetic-algos](https://github.com/tomhoffer/genetic-algos): My own Python library for genetic algorithm computation and it's application in stock-market trading. I'm currently rewriting it to Golang.
- [crz-search](https://github.com/tomhoffer/crz-search): Project implements a solution to find relationships and commonalities between 2 given Slovak companies to identify suspicious connections and help investigators discover potential illegal activities within public procurement. (e.g. money loundry, frauds, corrupcy schemes).
- [bvit](https://github.com/tomhoffer/bvit): This project hosts code to demonstrate how Nginx can be used to mitigate the impact of Dos/DDoS attacks using load balancing, rate-limiting and caching techniques.
- [fastapi-service](https://github.com/tomhoffer/fastapi-service): A dummy ASGI FastAPI server working with Postgres, Pytest for tests on all layers, Locust for performance tests and Github Workflows for CI.
- [event-stitching](https://github.com/tomhoffer/event-stitching): My first Golang project - A dummy service for resolving identity of customers performing actions on e-commerce websites.

Projects which I am not able to share on my github due to code licensing:
- City4Us: Mobile Augmented Reality application used by citizens to report public infrastructure issues to the city municipality. (Examples: Damaged infrastructure, incorrect parking).
