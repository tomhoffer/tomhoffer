### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ This github page host my hobby projects:
- [genetic-algos](https://github.com/tomhoffer/genetic-algos): My own Python library for genetic algorithm computation, soon to be published to PyPy.
- [crz-search](https://github.com/tomhoffer/crz-search): Project implements a solution to find relationships and commonalities between 2 given Slovak companies to identify suspicious connections and help investigators discover potential illegal activities within public procurement. (e.g. money loundry, frauds, corrupcy schemes).
- [bvit](https://github.com/tomhoffer/bvit): This project hosts code to demonstrate how Nginx can be used to mitigate the impact of Dos/DDoS attacks using load balancing, rate-limiting and caching techniques.

Projects which I am not able to share on my github due to code licensing:
- City4Us: Mobile Augmented Reality application used by citizens to report public infrastructure issues to the city municipality. (Examples: Damaged infrastructure, incorrect parking). With just a few taps, user is able file an issue together with the picture, GPS location and the type of the issue suggested by AI, using image recognition. Tech stack: Unity, C# (.NET), Python, Tensorflow, GCP.
- Master thesis: Alzheimer's disease diagnostics using Visual attention modelling over eye-tracking data with 82% accuracy over a clinical study.
